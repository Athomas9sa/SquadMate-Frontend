<h3>SquadMate is an application built to complete online forms by groups of organizers responsible for teams. 
- To gather information on member registration, medical need to know basis information.
- For events and who makes up the team, all to assist in helping you gather information of any member to be prepared for the events.<h3>


## Motivation
<h4>To assist people in need of assistance in areas where managers and coaches work with teams of minors for an event/tournament/match. An easy accessible function to complete the required forms necessary by parents of minors participating in team events in a timely manner. The ability to link information to medics (and other) in absence of the parents with the focus of being prepared.<h4>

## Usage
Sign-in and/or Sign-up as either the manager/coach of a team OR the person responsible for team members. Each having their own documentation privileges to navigate to with buttons. And shared viewing capabilities for managers/coaches. Keeps communication between the two parties, (- the parents and organizers), open and timely for team events to happen in a more organized fashion. Forms to be completed by team member's parents as needed and before the minor may participate. Administration will have documentation abilities to input, update, upload and prepare for the upcoming events and due dates, especially highlighting the function for printing the emergency cards needs for use at the event sites itself when you do not have the whole database with you.
